# Builds the schema ONCE from scratch and reports whether it goes through.
#
# Why the ordinary start does not cover this: on a grown database all tables are
# long since there, so it never shows when a statement touches a table that is
# only created further down. A new university starts with an EMPTY database, and
# there something like that aborts the whole start
# ("relation ... does not exist", Application startup failed).
#
# Happened exactly that way on the server on 2026-08-10. So run this before every
# larger schema rework.
#
# Two kinds of error, two different fixes:
#   * ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN  -> needed on a fresh database too. The target
#     table belongs BEFORE its use.
#   * UPDATE / DELETE on legacy data -> on an empty database there is nothing to
#     clean up. Skip it with _table_exists().
#
# It always shows only the NEXT error. Call it again after every fix until
# "SCHEMA OK" appears.
#
# Call from the project root:  backend/scripts/check_fresh_schema.sh
